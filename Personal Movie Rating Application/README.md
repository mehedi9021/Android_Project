# Personal_Movie_Rating_Application
Movies are cultural artifacts created by specific cultures. They reflect those cultures, and, in turn, affect them. A movie rating system is an organization designated to classify films based on their suitability for audiences due to their treatment of issues such as sex, violence, or substance abuse; their use of profanity; or other matters typically deemed unsuitable for children or adolescents. We developed an application on the purposes of own personal movie rating. Peoples are watching numerous movies in their everyday life all over the world. Sometimes its difficult to remember about the movie plot, story about a movie and their own opinion. And sometimes peoples are getting confused whether he/she has watched this movie or not. Using our application, people can save a record of the movie with their personal ratings. This will help them in further use of the record and will get a proper abstraction about the movie whether he has watched it or not previously and how was his expression about this movie.
